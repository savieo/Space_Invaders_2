# Space_Invaders_2
Our planet is in danger!  An army of Martians has decided to invade Earth. Fortunately, you are the hero of the situation, being the only person who is capable of annihilating these interplanetary villains.   Now, back in the real worldâ€¦ 
Your task is to build an arcade game called Space Invaders II. The game can be described as follows: Martians appear randomly on the screen, while a user-controlled ship at the bottom of the screen is able to shoot lasers at these Martians to destroy them one by one.
Naturally, the extraterrestrials will defend themselves by returning fire.The user will have the choice between three levels of difficulty. The higher the level, the more rapidly the Martians will appear on the screen, and the more aggressive they will be. 
There must be at least two types of Martians, with different values in terms of number of points. The normal rule is that if there are 15 Martians on the screen, you lose the game. If you destroy all the Martians, you win!
